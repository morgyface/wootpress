# wootpress

A naked WordPress theme for developers built on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

Nothing fancy, an evolving theme that gives me a base for WordPress projects

Install it as you would any other theme, copy it to the themes directory and activate.

Almost certainly needs combining with [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

This theme started out as the, now defunct, **Starkers** theme built on TwentyTen and evolved from there.

I do my best to keep it up to date, no warranties or support though I'm afraid.
